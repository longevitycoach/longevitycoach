## Description
Implement the hybrid secrets management strategy as outlined in [SEC-001: Secrets Management with 1Password and GitHub Secrets](../memory-bank/decisions/SEC-001-secrets-management.md).

## Background
Currently, we use 1Password for local development, but lack a standardized approach for CI/CD pipelines. This implementation will ensure secure secret management across all environments.

## Tasks

### 1. Local Development Setup
- [ ] Document 1Password CLI installation and setup
- [ ] Create/update `.env.example` with 1Password reference format
- [ ] Add `op signin` helper script/alias
- [ ] Document local development workflow

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Secrets for production environment
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for secret validation
- [ ] Configure 1Password service account for CI
- [ ] Document CI/CD secret rotation process

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new setup instructions
- [ ] Create SECRETS.md with detailed secret management guide
- [ ] Document emergency access procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All secrets are stored securely in appropriate stores
- [ ] Local development setup is documented and working
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines can access required secrets
- [ ] Team is trained on new processes

## Dependencies
- 1Password CLI installed and configured
- GitHub repository admin access
