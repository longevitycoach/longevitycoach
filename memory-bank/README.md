# Longevity Coach Memory Bank

Central knowledge repository for the Longevity-Focused Blood Analysis Platform, integrating expert methodologies from Dr. Ulrich Strunz, Thiemo Osterhaus, and Helena Orfanos-B√∂ckel with modern MCP architecture.

This directory serves as the central hub for project knowledge, decisions, and patterns. It's designed to help maintain context and share knowledge across the team, with a focus on healthcare compliance and AI-assisted development.
