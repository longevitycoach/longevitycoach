# Memory Bank

This directory serves as the central hub for project knowledge, decisions, and patterns. It's designed to help maintain context and share knowledge across the team.

## Structure

- `projectContext.md` - High-level project information and goals
- `activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
- `progress.md` - Track completed and in-progress work
- `decisionLog.md` - Record of important decisions
- `systemPatterns.md` - Documentation of system architecture and patterns

## How to Use

1. **Project Context**: Reference for onboarding and high-level understanding
2. **Active Context**: Check before starting work to understand current state
3. **Progress**: Update when completing tasks or starting new ones
4. **Decisions**: Add entries for significant architectural or product decisions
5. **System Patterns**: Document recurring patterns and best practices
