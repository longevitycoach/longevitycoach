This can lead to incomplete diagnoses, especially in the case of
subtle diseases or deficiencies.
Reference values are often based on population averages, which
may be undernourished. This can lead to thresholds being
considered normal when they actually indicate deficiencies.
Traditional dietary recommendations often emphasize the
consumption of carbohydrates, including whole grains. Critics
argue that this can lead to excessive consumption of refined
carbohydrates, which is detrimental to health.
Processed foods are high in sugar and trans fats, which increase
the risk of chronic diseases.
The nutrient content of fruits and vegetables is often lower than
expected, due to intensive farming and transportation. This can
lead to inadequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals. Due to
inadequate nutrient intake from regular diets, the use of dietary
supplements is often recommended, after regular diagnostics.

"Laboratory diagnostics for nutrient deficiencies are
ignored by health insurance companies, even though
they would be the basis for genuine prevention. Instead,
we prefer to finance expensive late-stage consequences
- a system that rewards illness and punishes health."
- Dr. Ulrich Strunz
Criticism of traditional medicine focuses on the need for more
comprehensive diagnostics and a balanced diet. Experts emphasize the
importance of individualized health assessments and adjusting dietary
recommendations based on modern science.
I've noticed that many doctors still practice traditional medicine.
However, specialists in modern oncomolecular medicine are scarce and
often fully booked, even for those willing to pay all the costs personally.
To fill this gap, I've started to read the books of these experts and use
their knowledge as a knowledge base for a multi-agent system. This
system allows me to integrate modern reference values and upload my
diagnostic results, providing a more personalized approach to LLM
management. I am experimenting with various AI systems such as Open
AI's ChatGPT, Azure AI Foundary, Perplexity AI, Dust.tt, N8N,
Conversational AI.

Perplexity Spaces define the context, instructions, knowledge

By leveraging this technology, I will analyze my health data in the context
of the latest medical research and recommendations. It's empowering to
have access to cutting-edge information and tools that help me make
informed decisions about my health. Despite the challenges in accessing
specialized care, this approach has given me a sense of control and
proactive engagement with my well-being.

Amino Acid diagram

After delving into "The Amino Revolution," I took a comprehensive
amino acid test provided by by for you to analyze crucial amino acids
that form complex proteins and hormones. The Aminogram results
revealed levels in the lower range for 8 essential, 4 semi-essential, and 8
non-essential amino acids, accompanied by a detailed report and a
personalized supplement plan. The challenge now lies in selecting costeffective supplement products with optimal coverage.
To address this, I've compiled a comparison table with Perplexity Deep
Research of recommended daily intakes (RDI) for essential amino acids
(based on biomarker testing) against amounts provided by two popular
supplements:

Perplexity Pro calculate the coverage of the recommendations per product

Product Details:
Forever Young Amino 10: 2 servings (32g) at €4.17/day
ISO-C® Whey Intense Vanilla: 3 servings (90g) at €3.99/day
AI also generate a comparison that allows for clear visualization of how
these supplements align with individual amino acid needs. Additional
similar products can be easily added to the table for a more
comprehensive analysis.

What is the right nutrition diet for me?

As an avid health enthusiast, I've experimented with various fasting
methods, including therapeutic fasting and 16:8 intermittent fasting.
However, these approaches presented unexpected challenges: I had to
stop my exercise program, lost muscle mass, and saw no significant
weight change even after three months. For the past year, I've also been
incorporating 16:8 intermittent fasting into my routine, but the results are
still limited.
In search of a more sustainable solution, I researched the
recommendations of Dr. Ulrich Strunz and other medical experts. Their
approach advocates a diet low in carbohydrates and sugar (less than 50
grams per day) while increasing fat and protein intake. This dietary shift
causes the body to switch from glucose metabolism to ketosis,
effectively burning fat stores without sacrificing muscle mass.

Consuming large amounts of fat daily raises concerns about my
cholesterol levels, especially if the fats are predominantly saturated fats
from animal sources. Studies have shown that low-carbohydrate, highfat diets can increase LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol),
apolipoprotein B levels, and the risk of cardiovascular events when
saturated fats dominate the diet.

Transitioning to healthier sources of fat, such as omega-3, 6, and 9 fatty
acids, is a practical solution for reducing cholesterol risks. Omega-3
fatty acids are particularly beneficial for lowering triglycerides and
improving heart health. Omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids also play an
important role in reducing LDL cholesterol and inflammation while
promoting HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol).
Omega-3: Fatty fish (salmon, sardines), flaxseed, chia seeds,
walnuts.
Omega-6: Nuts (almonds, walnuts), vegetable oils (soybean oil).
Omega-9: Olive oil, avocados, nuts like cashews and almonds.
Bone broth has also been shown to help regulate cholesterol levels and
protect blood vessels. It contains nutrients such as collagen, glycine,
and chondroitin, which may improve cardiovascular health and lower
blood pressure. A perfect addition to your keto lifestyle, promoting
satiety and metabolic flexibility.

Nourishing Bone Broth: A Keto-Friendly Elixir

I also learned that full-fat yogurt and cottage cheese for breakfast
contain saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol levels when consumed
in large amounts (>10%). However, yogurt also provides probiotics that
promote gut health and may indirectly benefit cholesterol regulation.
Studies suggest that yogurt enriched with flaxseed or oil, nuts, blue
berries, and raspberries may lower triglycerides and total cholesterol
while maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Flaxseed oil contains
lignans, which have antioxidant properties that may reduce inflammation
and protect against cardiovascular disease.

I use Cronometer App to track my Keto nutrition targets

After 4 weeks of following a ketogenic lifestyle, I experienced remarkable
results. I lost 6 pounds, reduced my body fat to 19%, and improved my
BMI to 20. These changes were not just numbers on a scale; I felt more
energized and focused throughout the day. So I learned:

"Keto is more than a diet. It's a lifestyle."

At first, I used urine test strips to measure my ketone levels during
ketosis. While these strips are convenient, I quickly realized that after a
few days, they no longer provided reliable results. This is because urine
ketone levels tend to decrease as the body becomes more efficient at
using ketones for energy.
To get more accurate and consistent readings, I switched to a blood
ketone meter. This device allows me to measure both glucose and
ketone levels directly in my blood, giving me a clearer picture of my
metabolic status. The Keto-Mojo also comes with its own mobile app
that seamlessly syncs with Apple Health and my keto food tracker,
Cronometer. This integration allows me to track my data over time and
integrate it for further diagnosis and optimization of my ketogenic
lifestyle.

Keto-Mojo Glucose and Keto test device and mobile app

Switching to blood testing has been a game-changer in tracking my
progress and ensuring I stay in nutritional ketosis. While blood meters
like Keto-Mojo are slightly more expensive than urine strips, their
accuracy and reliability make them an invaluable tool for anyone serious
about following a ketogenic diet. But I also learned on the hard way:

"Keto is like a marriage, it doesn't work if you cheat."
To enhance my results, I've incorporated several strategies:
1. Intermittent Fasting: I maintain the 16:8 fasting schedule, eating
my last meal by 6 PM and breaking my fast after 10 AM the next
day.

2. MCT Oil: I use MCT oil before starting and ending my daily fasting
period, which helps accelerate ketosis and provides quick energy.
3. Exogenous Ketones: These supplements have been crucial in
quickly achieving a ketotic state, especially when I'm just starting
or if I've consumed more carbs than usual.
4. Consistent Exercise: I maintain a robust exercise regimen of 1-2
hours daily, which not only supports my overall health but also
enhances fat utilization during ketosis.
5. Bone Broth: I've incorporated nutrient-rich bone broth into my diet.
It's an excellent source of minerals, collagen, and amino acids,
supporting joint health and gut function while aligning with
ketogenic principles.
6. Bulletproof Coffee: I start my day with a bulletproof coffee,
blending high-quality espresso with MCT oil and a small amount of
bone broth. This combination provides a sustained energy boost,
supports ketosis, and helps me maintain mental clarity throughout
the morning.
By the six-week mark, I was thrilled to see a major improvement in my
metabolic flexibility. My body had adapted to entering ketosis much
more efficiently, which allowed me to switch between fuel sources with
ease. This adaptation has been so important for keeping my energy
levels up and supporting my athletic performance.
I've found that a flexible approach works well for me. I try to stay in a
ketogenic state for about 5 out of 7 days each week. This approach
helps me get the best fat burning and athletic efficiency, while still giving
me some flexibility in my diet on the weekends.

After adopting a ketogenic diet, I experienced remarkable results within
6 weeks. My neurodermatitis completely resolved, as confirmed by a
dermatological evaluation. The weight loss led to the elimination of sleep
apnea-related snoring. My running routine improved significantly,
transitioning to a forefoot technique ("Der kleine Laufcoach" method)
with daily 7km runs and HIIT sprints. This change reduced joint stress
while maintaining my VO₂max at 47 mL/kg/min. The keto lifestyle not only
transformed my body composition but also enhanced my overall wellbeing and athletic performance.

Mikrobiom analysis

After watching the Netflix series "Hack Your Health: The Secrets of
Your Gut" I decided to analyze my microbiome by for you. I booked a
health consultant to explain the 21-page report of my microbiome and

amino acid results. The competent consultant's first feedback was that
the report was too detailed - a normal gut health test would have been
sufficient. She explained that I have a high percentage of the fatpromoting bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila. This is likely the main
reason why I struggle to lose weight and why my cholesterol levels
remain high, despite engaging in 1-2 hours of daily exercise.
To improve my gut health, she recommended cultivating beneficial
bacteria that were lacking in my microbiome:
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
Bifidobacterium species
Lactobacillus species

The consultant also noted the presence of potentially inflammatory
bacteria, Sutterella spp., which she suggested I could combat with bitter
drops. This analysis has provided valuable insights into my gut health
and potential strategies for improving my overall well-being.

Embracing the Cold: My Journey with the Wim
Hof Method and Ancient Breathing Techniques
But also Wim Hof, the Iceman was a true inspiration for pushing the
boundaries of human potential. His method of combining controlled
breathing, cold exposure, and mental focus has revolutionized our
understanding of the body's capabilities. As someone who's
experimented with cold showers and breathwork, I can attest to the
invigorating effects, though I'm far from Wim's superhuman feats! If
you're curious about harnessing your inner strength through cold
therapy and breathwork, check out the fascinating Wim Hof Method
documentary to learn more about this extraordinary man and his lifechanging techniques.

Wim Hof method: controlled breathing, cold exposure, and mental focus

Currently I'm preparing for a triathlon. So I combine, daily HIT, strength
and endurance excercises, Kethogene nutration. Triathlon training
demands exceptional respiratory efficiency, quick recovery, and mental
resilience. Two increasingly popular approaches among endurance
athletes are nasal breathing techniques (associated with James Nestor's
bestseller book Breath) and the book The Wim Hof Method, which
combines cold exposure with specialized breathing. Together, these
methods offer complementary benefits that can enhance triathlon
training and performance through improved respiratory efficiency, faster
recovery, and enhanced mental fortitude. For nasal breathing adaptation,
experts recommend beginning with short intervals during low-intensity
training.
The physiological benefits of nasal breathing-such as improved oxygen
utilization, reduced energy expenditure, and lower lactate accumulationare especially valuable for triathletes, given the sport’s multi-discipline
demands. By encouraging more efficient and regulated respiration, nasal
breathing helps sustain endurance and optimize performance across
swimming, cycling, and running.
Beyond athletic performance, I’ve personally experienced significant
improvements in my sleep quality since adopting nasal breathing and
losing weight. My sleep apnea and snoring have noticeably decreased.
As a result, I’m enjoying deeper, more restorative sleep, with marked
improvements in both REM and deep sleep phases. These changes are
clearly reflected in my Apple Health data, which shows a positive trend in
my sleep patterns over time.

Nasal Breathing and Sleep Quality: Scientific Evidence

My personal experience is well-supported by scientific research. Nasal
breathing during sleep is associated with several physiological
advantages:
Improved Oxygen Absorption: The nose acts as a natural filter
and humidifier, warming and moistening the air before it reaches

the lungs. This process optimizes oxygen uptake and helps
maintain stable blood oxygen levels throughout the night.
Reduced Sleep Apnea and Snoring: Studies show that nasal
breathing helps keep the upper airway more stable and less prone
to collapse, which reduces the frequency and severity of
obstructive events like snoring and apnea episodes. Research has
found that individuals who switch from mouth to nasal breathing
often experience fewer breathing interruptions and report better
overall sleep quality.
Enhanced Sleep Architecture: Scientific studies indicate that
mouth breathing is linked to lower oxygen saturation and more
fragmented sleep, resulting in less time spent in restorative REM
and deep sleep stages. Nasal breathing, by contrast, supports
healthier sleep architecture and improved daytime alertness.
Positive Impact on Sleep Tracking: These benefits are not just
subjective; they are often measurable. Many people, including
myself, see improvements in sleep metrics-such as increased REM
and deep sleep-when tracking with devices like Apple Health.
My shift to nasal breathing and weight loss has led to significant
improvements in my sleep apnea, snoring, and overall sleep quality. This
personal transformation is strongly supported by scientific research,
which demonstrates that nasal breathing enhances oxygenation,
reduces airway obstruction, and promotes deeper, more restorative
sleep. The data from my Apple Health app provides further evidence,
showing clear improvements in my sleep patterns over time.

Aware Health Testing: A Modern Approach for
Diagnostics

In the pursuit of optimizing my health, I decided to test the Aware App
and its associated blood testing services. Unlike traditional lab reports,
which often present results in printed formats with varying units (mg, ml,
mmol) and static reference ranges, Aware offers a highly modern and
user-friendly approach.
The Berlin Aware healthtech startup provides a convenient and
innovative solution for regular blood testing and health monitoring. Using
their app and test centers, individuals can track over 60 biomarkers
related to nutrition, longevity, hormones, heart health, and more. Here
are the key features:
1. Aware offers comprehensive blood tests that analyze more than
twice the biomarkers of a standard blood count. These tests cover
immune system, kidney, liver, metabolic, hormonal, vitamin, and
mineral areas. Aware operates on a subscription basis (€179/year
for two tests), with options for additional specialized tests.
2. App booking and results are convenient. Test centers are located
and equipped with private booths. Results are available digitally
within 48 hours.
3. The Aware App analyzes 54 biomarkers, providing a detailed
overview of health. Forty-four were within range, while ten were out
of range. The app displays clear visual indicators.
4. Through partnerships like TeleClinic, users can immediately consult

Health Apps are booming - Here the results of my latest tests in Aware App

Some of the notable out-of-range biomarkers included:
High LDL and non-HDL cholesterol, which can be a sign of heart
problems.
Low DHA levels, suggesting a need for omega-3 supplementation.
There was also slightly high glucose, which might mean changes to
my diet.
Some of the immune-related stuff like IgG and lymphocyte percentage
were lower than expected.The Aware PDF export is way better than
traditional lab print-outs for my doctor. It's clearer, more organized, and
easier to get to. It includes more diagnostics (like vitamin B12 and
omega-3 levels) and visual summaries, which makes it easier to
understand the results.
With Perplexity, I can compare the significant values from the last few
years of various lab formats and export them as a CSV file:

Manus AI

With the rapid evolution of digital health tools, AI agents like Manus are
transforming how individuals collect, analyze, and interpret their health
data. I want share my practical experience using Manus AI to prepare,
understand, and communicate my diagnostic, health, sport, and sleep
data—especially in the context of generating comprehensive reports for
medical consultations, such as with the Charité Lipid Ambulance, home
physicians, and nutrition or sports consultants.
Manus AI allows me to aggregate data from various sources, including
Apple Health, sport trackers, and laboratory results. This centralized
approach enables a holistic view of my health trends, such as lipid
values, cardiovascular metrics, and sleep quality, over time.
One of Manus’s most valuable features is its ability to automatically
generate structured, medically relevant reports. These reports are
tailored for different audiences: specialist clinics (like lipid ambulances),
general practitioners, or lifestyle consultants. The reports synthesize
complex data into understandable narratives and visualizations, making
it easier to discuss findings with healthcare professionals.
Leveraging the latest insights from molecular medicine and metabolic
health, Manus AI can suggest individualized interventions—ranging from
dietary adjustments (e.g., ketogenic or low-carb diets) to exercise
regimens and breathing exercises. This aligns with the approaches
advocated by leading experts such as Dr. Ulrich Strunz, Prof. Bernd
Kleine-Gunk, and others, who emphasize the synergy between lifestyle,
nutrition, and metabolic flexibility.

Multi Agents and integration with MCP access individual data

By leveraging MCP these specialized agents can seamlessly integrate
and share insights, creating a unified health optimization strategy. As
explored in my previous article "Model Context Protocol (MCP): The
USB-C Standard for AI Integration in Software Development" enables
secure, standardized communication between diverse AI tools and data
sources. This architecture allows for real-time adaptation of health
recommendations based on the latest scientific research and individual
biomarker data.

Summary and outlook

This story is about my personal journey in trying to get more advanced
medical information and using technology to improve health
management, especially when specialized care is hard to find.
Right now, there's no way to access Perplexity Spaces directly through
the API. You can't get to the uploaded knowledge from books or links to
health communities. The sorting features of Perplexity Spaces, like
sorting threads and files by topic or project, are only available through
the Perplexity interface and not through the API.
To get around this, I'm planning to use the Multi-Agent System Dust.tt to
create a multi-step workflow with MCP. I'll use Claude Desktop as the
client interface. I'm currently developing a MCP Server to connect to
specialist DUST agents. You can find the open-source version of
the MCP server on Github. Stay tuned for updates!
