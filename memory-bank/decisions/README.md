# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory tracks all significant architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle. Each decision is documented as a Markdown file following the [Architecture Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) (ADR) pattern.

## Purpose

- Provide a record of significant design decisions and their context
- Help new team members understand the reasoning behind technical choices
- Enable better decision-making by documenting past considerations
- Support knowledge sharing and onboarding

## Decision Record Template

Create new ADRs using this template:

```markdown
# [Short title of solved problem and solution]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-xxx](filename.md)]

## Context
[What is the issue or opportunity being addressed?]
[What is the problem we're trying to solve?]
[What is the impact of not making this decision?]

## Decision
[What is the change we're proposing or have agreed to implement?]
[What specific changes are required to implement this decision?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do?]
[What are the trade-offs of this decision?]
[What are the risks involved?]
[How will this impact existing functionality?]

## Related
- Issue: #[issue-number] (if applicable)
- PR: #[pr-number] (if applicable)
- Supersedes: [ADR-xxx](filename.md) (if applicable)
- Superseded by: [ADR-xxx](filename.md) (if applicable)
```

## Naming Convention

ADRs follow this naming pattern:
```
dec-###-descriptive-title-using-dashes.md
```

Where:
- `###` is a sequential number (e.g., 001, 002)
- The title is a brief description in lowercase with words separated by hyphens

## How to Create a New ADR

1. Identify a significant architectural decision that needs to be made
2. Create a new Markdown file following the naming convention
3. Use the template to document the decision
4. Submit a PR for review
5. Update this README with the new decision

## Review Process

1. New ADRs should be proposed as draft PRs
2. Team members review and provide feedback
3. Once consensus is reached, the ADR is marked as "Accepted"
4. The PR is merged into the main branch

## Maintenance

- Keep ADRs up to date as the system evolves
- Mark decisions as "Superseded" when they are replaced by new ones
- Reference related ADRs and issues for better traceability
