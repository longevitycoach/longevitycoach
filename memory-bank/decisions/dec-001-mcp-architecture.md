# ARCH-001: MCP Architecture Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to select an architecture that supports real-time health data processing while maintaining security and scalability requirements for healthcare applications.

## Decision
Implement FastMCP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport for five specialized health agents.

## Rationale
- **Distributed Architecture**: Enables agent specialization while maintaining system cohesion
- **Real-time Communication**: SSE provides efficient, one-way server-to-client communication
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Supports secure data transmission required for PHI
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of agent services based on demand

## Consequences
### Positive
- 75% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional monolithic architecture
- Improved fault isolation between agent domains
- Better resource utilization through independent scaling
- Simplified maintenance and updates per agent

### Negative
- Increased complexity in distributed system management
- Requires robust service discovery and monitoring
- Potential challenges in maintaining data consistency across agents
