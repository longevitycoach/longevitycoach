# Data Encryption and Backup Strategy

## Context

We need to establish secure practices for handling sensitive health information and ensure proper version control and backup strategies for our project documentation and codebase.

## Decision

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - All sensitive health information at rest will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
   - Encryption keys will be managed securely and never stored in version control.
   - Data in transit will be protected using TLS 1.2 or higher.

2. **Version Control and Backup Strategy**:
   - We will rely on GitHub's version control system for maintaining file history and backups.
   - `.bak` files will be removed from the repository as they are redundant with Git's versioning capabilities.
   - Backup scripts will be preserved in the `scripts/` directory for potential future use but will not be part of the regular workflow.
   - The `.gitignore` file will be updated to prevent `.bak` files from being committed.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Simplified workflow**: No need to manage `.bak` files manually.
- **Better version control**: Git provides robust versioning, branching, and history tracking.
- **Reduced repository size**: Removing duplicate `.bak` files will reduce the repository size.
- **Improved security**: Clearer separation between active files and historical versions.

### Drawbacks
- Team members will need to be familiar with Git's version control features.
- Historical `.bak` files will need to be removed from the repository.

## Implementation

1. Remove all `.bak` files from the repository
2. Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.bak` files
3. Document the backup strategy in the project's README
4. Train team members on using Git's version control features
