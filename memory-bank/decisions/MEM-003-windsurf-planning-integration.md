# Windsurf Planning Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the integration between Windsurf's planning capabilities and the project's memory bank system, ensuring consistent context management and preventing context loss over time.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Data Flow
```
[Windsurf Planning] <-> [Memory Bank] <-> [GitHub/Git]
      |                       |
      v                       v
[Team Members]         [Documentation]
```

### 2. Key Components

#### Planning Cycles
- **Strategic (Quarterly)**: Aligns with high-level goals and OKRs
- **Release (Monthly)**: Coordinates feature development and releases
- **Sprint (Bi-weekly)**: Manages development iterations
- **Daily**: Handles immediate tasks and blockers

#### Memory Integration Points
- **Automatic Context Updates**: Every 4 hours
- **Context Retention**: 90 days by default
- **Max Active Items**: 10 per planning cycle
- **Max Retained Items**: 100 across all cycles

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Context Management

#### Active Context
- Limited to 10 active items per planning cycle
- Automatically pruned after 30 days of inactivity
- Prioritized by:
  1. Current sprint/release relevance
  2. Dependency criticality
  3. Last accessed time

#### Context Updates
- Triggered by:
  - Planning cycle transitions
  - Code commits/PRs
  - Manual updates
  - Scheduled syncs (every 4 hours)

### 2. Planning Rules

#### Context Retention
- **Active**: 30 days from last access
- **Recent**: 90 days from creation
- **Archived**: 1+ year, accessible but not in active context

#### Update Constraints
- Minimum 24-hour review cycle for planning changes
- Maximum 90-day planning horizon
- Maximum 5 concurrent initiatives

### 3. Integration with Memory Bank

#### Directory Structure
```

      strategic/
      release/
      sprint/
      daily/
    metrics/
    decisions/
    artifacts/
```

#### File Naming Convention
`[TYPE]-[DATE]-[DESCRIPTION].[EXT]`
- TYPE: decision|metric|plan|note
- DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
- DESCRIPTION: kebab-case-description

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Planning Cycle Start
1. Create new cycle directory
2. Load relevant context from memory bank
3. Update planning artifacts
4. Notify team of new cycle

### 2. Daily Operations
1. Update active context based on work
2. Log decisions and updates
3. Track metrics and blockers
4. Sync with version control

### 3. Cycle Review
1. Generate metrics report
2. Archive completed work
3. Update knowledge base
4. Plan next cycle

## Automation Rules

### 1. Context Updates
- **When**: On commit, PR, or manual trigger
- **What**:
  - Update relevant planning artifacts
  - Link to related decisions
  - Track changes in context

### 2. Reminders
- **When**: 24h before cycle end
- **What**:
  - Incomplete tasks
  - Pending decisions
  - Upcoming deadlines

### 3. Cleanup
- **When**: Weekly
- **What**:
  - Archive old cycles
  - Prune stale context
  - Update metrics

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Key Metrics
1. **Planning Accuracy**
   - Target: >85% of planned items completed
   - Measured per sprint/release

2. **Context Retention**
   - Target: >90% of relevant context available
   - Measured by team feedback

3. **Update Compliance**
   - Target: >95% of updates within SLA
   - Measured by automated checks

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update context at least daily
   - Review planning artifacts weekly
   - Conduct full cycle reviews

2. **Documentation**
   - Link all decisions to relevant code
   - Maintain clear change history
   - Use consistent naming conventions

3. **Team Collaboration**
   - Share context updates in team channels
   - Review planning artifacts together
   - Provide feedback on context relevance
