# DB-001: TimescaleDB for Time-Series Data

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a database solution that efficiently handles time-series health data with high write throughput and complex analytical queries.

## Decision
Use TimescaleDB extension on top of PostgreSQL for all time-series health data.

## Rationale
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster queries for time-series data
- **Storage Efficiency**: 94% compression ratio for time-series data
- **SQL Compatibility**: Full PostgreSQL compatibility
- **Maturity**: Production-ready with enterprise support
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Meets healthcare data requirements

## Consequences
### Positive
- Efficient storage of high-frequency biomarker data
- Fast time-based queries for trend analysis
- Seamless integration with existing PostgreSQL tooling
- Automatic data retention policies

### Negative
- Additional operational complexity
- Requires PostgreSQL 12+
- Slightly higher memory usage
