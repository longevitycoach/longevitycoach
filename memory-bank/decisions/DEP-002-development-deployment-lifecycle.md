# DEP-002: Development and Deployment Lifecycle

## Decision

Establish a clear development and deployment lifecycle for the Longevity Coach project,
ensuring reliable and consistent deployments to GitHub Pages.

## Context

We need to ensure that:

1. The deployment process is reliable and automated
2. The site is always in a deployable state
3. Changes are properly tested before deployment
4. The deployment process is well-documented

## Rules for Development and Deployment

### 1. Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code, automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `fix/*`: Bug fix branches

### 2. Automated Testing

#### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Test complete user flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor and enforce performance budgets

#### Testing Requirements

- All tests must pass before merging to `main`
- Test coverage should be maintained above 80%
- Critical paths must have E2E test coverage
- Performance budgets must not be exceeded

#### Test Execution

- Run on every push and pull request
- Execute in parallel for faster feedback
- Cache dependencies between runs for performance
- Generate test coverage reports
- Enforce code coverage thresholds

### 3. Deployment Process

- All changes must be reviewed via pull requests
- All automated tests must pass before merging to main
- Code coverage requirements must be met
- The main branch is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- Only static assets should be committed to the `docs` directory
- Deployment rollback procedures must be tested regularly

### 4. GitHub Pages Configuration

- Source: `docs` directory on the `main` branch
- No build step required (static site)
- Custom domain support via CNAME
- Automated deployment on push to main

### 5. Development Workflow

1. Create a feature/fix branch from `develop`
2. Make changes and commit with descriptive messages
3. Push branch and create a pull request
4. Get code review and approval
5. Merge to `develop` after approval
6. Deploy to staging for testing (if applicable)
7. Merge to `main` for production deployment

### 6. Error Handling

- Failed deployments should trigger notifications
- Rollback procedures should be documented
- Monitoring should be in place for the production site

## Implementation

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow with testing matrix
2. Configure test coverage reporting
3. Add required status checks for pull requests
4. Document the testing and deployment processes
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
6. Implement performance budgets
7. Configure accessibility testing

## Testing Framework

### Tools

- **Test Runner**: Jest
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Accessibility**: axe-core
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI
- **Coverage**: Istanbul/NYC

### Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Run E2E tests
      run: npm run test:e2e
      
    - name: Run accessibility tests
      run: npm run test:a11y
      
    - name: Run performance tests
      run: npm run test:perf
      
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
        file: ./coverage/lcov.info
        fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### Test Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:a11y": "jest --config=jest.a11y.config.js",
    "test:perf": "lighthouse-ci"
  }
}
```

## Status

ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Next Steps

1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Implement initial test suite
3. Configure GitHub Actions
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Document test coverage requirements
6. Train team on testing practices
