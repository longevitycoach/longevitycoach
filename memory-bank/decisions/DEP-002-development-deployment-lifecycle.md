# DEP-002: Development and Deployment Lifecycle

## Decision

Establish a clear development and deployment lifecycle for the Longevity Coach project, ensuring reliable and consistent deployments to GitHub Pages.

## Context

We need to ensure that:

1. The deployment process is reliable and automated
2. The site is always in a deployable state
3. Changes are properly tested before deployment
4. The deployment process is well-documented

## Rules for Development and Deployment

### 1. Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code, automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `fix/*`: Bug fix branches

### 2. Deployment Process

- All changes must be reviewed via pull requests
- Automated tests must pass before merging to main
- The main branch is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- Only static assets should be committed to the `docs` directory

### 3. GitHub Pages Configuration

- Source: `docs` directory on the `main` branch
- No build step required (static site)
- Custom domain support via CNAME
- Automated deployment on push to main

### 4. Development Workflow

1. Create a feature/fix branch from `develop`
2. Make changes and commit with descriptive messages
3. Push branch and create a pull request
4. Get code review and approval
5. Merge to `develop` after approval
6. Deploy to staging for testing (if applicable)
7. Merge to `main` for production deployment

### 5. Error Handling

- Failed deployments should trigger notifications
- Rollback procedures should be documented
- Monitoring should be in place for the production site

## Implementation

1. Update GitHub Actions workflow to handle static sites
2. Add required status checks for pull requests
3. Document the deployment process
4. Set up monitoring (if applicable)

## Status

âœ… Implemented
